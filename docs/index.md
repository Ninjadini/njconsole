NjConsole is the ultimate debug console you never knew you needed — until now.

- 📜 Runtime log viewer with powerful filtering and search (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
- ⚡ Ultra-fast logging with near-zero allocations for high-performance debugging
- 🔍 Object inspector — view/edit fields and properties, follow references, and call methods directly
- 🔗 Log entries can link to objects — tap to inspect and tweak them instantly
- 📂 Hierarchy viewer — browse live GameObjects and their components, then inspect them in detail using the object inspector
- 🎮 Custom menu options and keybindings — for cheats, dev tools, and prototyping
- 🎯 Quick-access shortcuts — assign to any screen corner for rapid access while testing
- 🖥️ Cross-platform support — works in Unity Editor, standalone, WebGL, and mobile (supports safe areas, touch input, keyboard, and all orientations)
- 🖼️ Dockable editor window and in-game floating overlay for large screens

    - 📱 App, device, and system info viewer
- 🧱 Modular design — plug in your own modules and panels
- ✂️ Removable — Easily disable NjConsole at compile-time with `#ifdef NJCONSOLE_DISABLE` (saves memory, reduces build size, and prevents unintended access in production)
